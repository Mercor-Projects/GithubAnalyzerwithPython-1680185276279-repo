### Welcome to the Github Analyzer with Python challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description


**General Overview:**

In this project, you will build a web scraper in Python that extracts the top Python projects from GitHub based on their stars, forks, or other criteria. You will use the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the data and the Pandas library to analyze and manipulate it. The project will have a user interface that allows users to sort the projects by stars, forks, or other criteria.



**Required Components:**

- Web Scraping: Use the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from the GitHub website. You can scrape data such as project name, description, stars, forks, and other relevant details.
- Data Analysis: Use the pandas library to analyze and manipulate the scraped data. You can sort the projects by stars, forks, or other criteria, and display the top projects in a table or chart.
- User Interface: Use a web framework like Flask to create a simple user interface that displays the top Python projects from GitHub. The interface should allow users to sort the projects by stars, forks, or other criteria.

**Optional Components:**

- Scraping additional data: In addition to project name, description, stars, and forks, you can scrape other data like the project contributors, programming language, and last commit date.
- Data visualization: Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualizations of the top Python projects based on their stars, forks, or other criteria.
- Automated scraping: Use a scheduler to automate the scraping process and update the project data regularly.
- Project filtering: Allow users to filter the top Python projects by programming language, topic, or other criteria.
